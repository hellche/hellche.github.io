Together with colleagues, we worked on analyzing funding policies and estimated the reputation in academia based on surveys and large-scale bibliometric data. I am particularly interested in gender disparities in science, especially the study of parenthood and homophily in mentorship in different research fields.\n\nI'm drawn to projects investigating inequality and proposing evidence-based policies to mitigate its effects. I'm passionate about working with data and using visualizations to help tell compelling stories. As an Open Science enthusiast, I'm committed to incorporating these principles into my work and continue developing my skills in their application.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","search":false,"theme":{"light":"simplex"},"title":"Elena Chechik","about":{"template":"trestles","image":"files/prof_pic.jpg","links":[{"icon":"Google Scholar","text":"CV","file":"files/CV.pdf"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/hellche"},{"icon":"twitter","text":"twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/hellche"},{"icon":"Email","text":"Email","href":"mailto:elenachechik@gmail.com"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
