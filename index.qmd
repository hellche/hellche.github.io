##### About me

I'm a junior researcher in science of science and education sciences with an economics and econometrics background.

For the last three years, I have worked at the Center for Institutional Analysis of Science and Education, [European University of St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/). Together with colleagues, we worked on analyzing funding policies, estimated the reputation in academia, and worked with large-scale bibliometric data. Also, I worked on projects that explored gender disparities in science, parenthood, and homophily in mentorship.
