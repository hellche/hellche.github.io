##### About me

I am a junior researcher with a background in economics and econometrics, specializing in education science and  science of science. Currently, I am a researcher and PhD student at the Department of Methodology, [Europa-Universit√§t Flensburg](https://www.uni-flensburg.de/zml/wer-wir-sind/projektmitarbeitende), where I am working on the project "Admission Restrictions and Inequality in Higher Education." Prior to this, for three years, I was part of the Center for Institutional Analysis of Science and Education at the [European University of St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/), where my work focused on analyzing funding policies and evaluating reputation in academia through the use of surveys and large-scale bibliometric data. I am particularly interested in exploring gender inequality and developing evidence-based policies to address it. Additionally, I am passionate about leveraging visualizations to communicate compelling stories.

As someone who strongly believes in the value of Open Science, I am committed to incorporating its principles into my work and constantly expanding my skills in its application.
