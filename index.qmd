##### About me

I am a junior researcher with a background in economics and econometrics, specializing in the science of science and education sciences. For the past three years, I have been a part of the Center for Institutional Analysis of Science and Education at the [European University of St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/), where my work has focused on analyzing funding policies and evaluating reputation in academia through the use of surveys and large-scale bibliometric data. I am particularly interested in exploring gender inequality and developing evidence-based policies to address it. Additionally, I am passionate about leveraging visualizations to communicate compelling stories.

As someone who believes strongly in the value of Open Science, I am committed to incorporating its principles into my work and constantly expanding my skills in its application.
